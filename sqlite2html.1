.\" .Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sqlite2html
.Op Fl v
.Ar schema
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts an
.Xr sqlite3 1
schema file to an HTML5 fragment.
Its only argument is
.Fl v ,
which causes the parser to emit informational messages on stderr.
.Pp
The outputted HTML5 fragment consists of a
.Li <dl class="tabs">
list consisting of tables; and then for each table, a
.Li <dl class="cols">
list of columns.
The
.Li <dt>
for each list entry consists of the name of the table or column and has
its ID attribute set to the transformed name.
The
.Li <dd>
for each list begins with a
.Li <div class="comment">
if the table or column is preceeded by comments.
.Pp
The
.Li @
character within a comment is special: the following table name and
optional column name will be transformed into an HTML link to the
identifier.
Thus,
.Li @foo.bar
will point to the
.Dq bar
column in table
.Dq foo .
If this identifier is not followed by white-space, you may quote the
identifier to prevent subsequent characters from being pulled into the
identifier, e.g.,
.Li @"foo.bar" .
